# react-ctfwhi

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ctfwhi)

This project is for utilizing stateful logic of react component by other react component
using three different pattern

1. HOC pattern
2. Render pattern
3. Hooks pattern

as we know one of motivation for building hooks is sharing statefull logic between the component . before hooks we were using HOC and Render pattern
